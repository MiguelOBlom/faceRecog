Face recognition with face mask
supervised method
probably unlabeled data

Mask gallery
Face dataset
	Requirements:
		- Strong requirement: images grouped by person (img - id relationship)
		- Needs to be representative of general population
		- Needs to be representative of "portraits"
		- Weak requirement: multiple images per person

	Candidates:
		- WIDER FACE: A Face Detection Benchmark
			[Unqualified] Labeled on scale, pose, occlusion, expression, makeup and illumination, but no IDs
			http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/


		- color FERET Database
			Had to mail them, got a database
			Different angles of same person
			But some are grayscale
			https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/color-feret-database


		- Flickr-Faces-HQ Dataset (FFHQ)
			[Unqualified] Not labeled on IDs
			https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset

		- Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset
			May be biased, celebrity faces may not be representative of general population
			"In the wild" images, so may not be representative of "portraits"
			http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

		- Labelled Faces in the Wild Home (LFW) Dataset
			Celebrity faces again
			In the wild
			E.g. there are images in this dataset where tennis players pull a weird face while hitting a ball...

		- Cross-Age LFW 
			used in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05804v2.pdf
			similar to usual LFW, but different ages
			http://whdeng.cn/CALFW/index.html?reload=true

		- Pins Face Recognition
			Cropped images of celebrities

Going with the FERET database for now...
cd data/images;
for i in {0..9}; do sudo bunzip2 *$i/*.ppm.bz2; done

11338 images and 997 people






OpenCV can already detect my face and my face with a mask on

We are given a face and a cascade

Can we create face recognition that improves upon full face recogntion when the faces wear masks?
- How good does full face recognition work for full faces and faces with masks?
	- Get a labeled dataset of faces + the same faces with masks
	- Create a face recongizer that predicts the labels of the faces
	- Train the full(/masked/mixed <- probably no) face recognizer on the full faces dataset and predict seen/unseen full/masked/mixed faces
	- See where we can improve
- How can we improve on this?
	- Cascade?
	- Train on masked faces?
